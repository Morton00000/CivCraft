##CivCraft
==========

###This mod is a work in progress.

It was originaly conceived and started by Pooperman.

I later started to help with the textures and then later the coding.

Pooperman has since stopped working on the mod and has given me permision to make it open source.

**I do not know Java but have managed to figure out enough to get the mod to its current state.**

**Any help is appreciated.**

###Mod Direction Information

Curently the only things to work on are:

	* Getting the Mold Furnace to smelt a mold and the reqired materials into either a tool head or a armor piece.
	* Renaming the mod to something more proper.

***
###Other Information

Also I have used some EE3 code to help with various things but I don't remember all the areas where it is used.

	* It was used in the ConfigurationHandler.
	* It was used in the onBlockActivate on all the machines.

The GitHub for EE3 can be found [here](https://github.com/pahimar/Equivalent-Exchange-3).

If you would like to compile the mod then follow the instructions on the EE3 GitHub.
