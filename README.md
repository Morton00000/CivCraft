##CivCraft
***
###This mod is a work in progress.

It was originaly conceived and started by Pooperman.

I later started to help with the textures and then later the coding.

Pooperman has since stopped working on the mod and has given me permision to make it open source.

The current version of the mod is not released anywhere but the old fourm post for the mod can be found [here](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1588723-146forgewip-civcraft-021-now-with-easybake-oven/).

Things have changed since that post.

**I do not know Java but have managed to figure out enough to get the mod to its current state.**

**Any help is appreciated.**

###Mod Direction Information

Current things to work on are:

	* Getting the Mold Furnace to smelt a mold and the reqired materials into either a tool head or a armor piece.
		- fired molds will take damage and can be used more than once
		- simular to the RP2 alloy furnace
	* Renaming the mod to something more proper.
	* Fix the naming for the creative tabs ingame.
	* Various support for other mods like IC2 and RailCraft.
	* Posibly add in more food? (I just want to do textures for more food)

###Other Information

Also I have used some EE3 code to help with various things but I don't remember all the areas where it is used.

	* It was used in the ConfigurationHandler.
	* It was used in the onBlockActivate on all the machines.
	* I think the Network and Proxy files.
	* The creative tabs code in CivCraftBase.
	* The icon code for the BaseBlock/BaseItem files.

The GitHub for EE3 can be found [here](https://github.com/pahimar/Equivalent-Exchange-3).

If you would like to compile the mod then follow the instructions on the EE3 GitHub.
