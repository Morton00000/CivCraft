CivCraft
========

This mod is a work in progress.
It was originaly conceived and started by Pooperman.

I later started to help with the textures and then later the coding.
Pooperman has since stopped working on the mod and has given me permision to make it open source.

I do not know Java but have managed to figure out enough to get the mod to its current state.
Any help is appreciated.
I also believe the mod needs a name change but don't know of a good name for it.

Also I have used some EE3 code to help with various things but I don't remember the exact areas where it is used.
The GitHub for EE3 can be found [here](https://github.com/pahimar/Equivalent-Exchange-3).
